  <h1>About AlgoCrate</h1>
  <p>
    AlgoCrate is a student-first platform crafted to bridge the gap between what’s taught in classrooms and what the tech industry truly expects. Built with the modern BTech CSE student in mind, it helps simplify your journey from beginner to confident, career-ready developer.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Journey, Simplified</h2>
  <p>
    Most first-year students feel overwhelmed by scattered tutorials, inconsistent advice, and confusing roadmaps. AlgoCrate solves this by offering a structured, hands-on approach through focused learning paths called “crates.” Each crate targets a core area of your tech growth—whether it’s mastering Data Structures and Algorithms, building full-stack web apps, polishing your resume, or preparing for product-based interviews.
  </p>

  <h2>More Than Just Learning</h2>
  <p>
    AlgoCrate isn’t a content dump. It’s a smart platform that helps you learn, apply, and grow—all in one place. It’s designed to make you job-ready, not just tutorial-complete. You’ll build real-world projects, prep for coding rounds, analyze your resume with AI, and practice interviews with smart mock tools—all while tracking your own growth.
  </p>

  <h2>Powered by AI, Personalized for You</h2>
  <p>
    The platform intelligently adapts to your progress and goals. Mock interview simulators, resume analyzers, performance tracking dashboards, and personalized recommendations make your journey more efficient and focused. You don’t waste time searching—you get what you need, when you need it.
  </p>

  <h2>Built for the Students Who Want More</h2>
  <p>
    Whether you’re in your first semester figuring out what DSA even means, or you're two months away from internship season, AlgoCrate meets you where you are and helps you level up. It’s for students who don’t want to rely on random YouTube playlists or feel stuck between choices.
  </p>

  <h2>Shaping Confident Engineers</h2>
  <p>
    At its core, AlgoCrate is about clarity, confidence, and progress. It's not just a website — it's your personal companion from “Hello World” to your first tech offer. As the platform evolves, it will bring even more tools, open-source opportunities, and hackathon support to help you rise in the developer world.
